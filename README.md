# Shopping List App

A web application for managing shopping lists — built as a personal, independent alternative to existing shopping list apps.

## Overview

A backend + frontend service that allows users to:

- Create and manage multiple shopping lists
- Add, remove, and check off items
- Name lists by purpose (e.g. groceries, hardware store, vinted)
- Access their shopping lists from anywhere

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| [Scala 3](https://docs.scala-lang.org/) | Language | Expressive, type-safe, functional-first JVM language with excellent concurrency support |
| [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) | Build tool | The standard Scala build tool — handles compilation, dependency management, testing, and running |
| [Play Framework 3.x](https://www.playframework.com/) | Web framework | Builds the web application and handles REST APIs. Stateless, non-blocking architecture. Hot-reloads code changes in dev mode so you see edits instantly without restarting the server |
| [Apache Pekko](https://pekko.apache.org/) | Concurrency & streaming | Actor-based message passing for highly concurrent state management. Streams API for reactive frontend↔backend data flow. Handles backpressure, fault tolerance, and supervision out of the box |
| [H2](https://h2database.com/) | Database (dev) | Lightweight in-memory SQL database for local development — zero setup, auto-creates on startup. May be swapped for PostgreSQL in production |
| [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/) | Testing | The standard Scala testing framework — flexible DSL styles, rich matchers, integrates with mocking libraries |

### Why Apache Pekko over Akka?

Akka changed to a Business Source License (BSL) in 2022, making it non-free for production use. [Apache Pekko](https://pekko.apache.org/) is the community-maintained open-source fork (Apache 2.0 licensed), hosted by the Apache Software Foundation. Play Framework 3.x is already built on Pekko rather than Akka.

### Key Features of the Stack

- **Hot reload** — Play recompiles and reloads on every request in dev mode, no server restart needed
- **Actor model** — Pekko actors provide lightweight concurrent entities that communicate via messages, avoiding shared mutable state
- **Reactive streams** — Pekko Streams handles async data pipelines with built-in backpressure between frontend and backend
- **Type safety** — Scala 3's type system catches errors at compile time; case classes and sealed traits model the domain precisely
- **Non-blocking I/O** — Play and Pekko are async-first, handling many concurrent connections on few threads

## Project Status

🚧 **Work in progress** — migrating from a Java/Spring Boot prototype to idiomatic Scala.

## How To Run

```
sbt run
```

## Configuration

Defined in `src/main/resources/application.conf` (HOCON format, used by Play/Pekko).

## API

_TODO — endpoints to be defined as migration progresses._
